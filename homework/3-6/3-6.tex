    This means that there exists a permutation $\pi$ of $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, such that $w_{\pi(i)}$ is a correct response to $u_i$, for $0 \leq i \leq 6$.

  \section{[GC] Problem 8.3}
  For graph $G_1$, $U$ can be matched to $W$. One possible matching is $\{(a, x), (b, w), (c, v), (d, z), (e, y)\}$. \par
  For graph $G_2$, $U$ can't be matched to $W$. Consider vertex set $\{b, d, e\}$, the cardinality of its neighborhood is only 2, which violates Hall's condition.

  \section{[GC] Problem 8.4}
  For all subset $U'$ of $U$, since every two vertices in $U'$ have distinct degrees, the maximum degree of all vertices of $U'$ is at least $|U'|$, and thus the cardinality of the neighborhood of $U'$ is at least $|U'|$. Therefore, the graph $G$ satisfies Hall's condition, which means $G$ contains a perfect matching.

  \section{[GC] Problem 9.6}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item True. It is obvious that if a graph does not contain a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$, neither does its subgraph. Therefore, by Kuratowski's Theorem, every subgraph of a planar graph is planar.
    \item False. For any nonplanar graph, if we take one of its vertices as a trivial subgraph, then it is obviously a planar subgraph.
    \item False. Consider $K_5$, removing any of its edges or vertices will make the resulting graph not contain a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$, so $K_5$ is a counterexample to this statement.
    \item False. If we insert an vertex to any edge of $K_5$, the resulting graph does not contain $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph, however, it is still nonplanar.
    \item False. Consider the union of $K_5$ and $C_3$, with order $n = 8$ and size $m = 13$, which satisfies $m \leq 3n-6$. However, one of its components is nonplanar, and thus the graph is nonplanar.
    \item False. Consider the union of $K_{3,3}$ and $C_3$, it has a triangle and contains no subdivision of $K_5$ as a subgraph, however, it is  nonplanar.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \section{[GC] Problem 9.13}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Since $G$ contains no triangle, the boundary of every region has at least 4 edges. Because every edge belongs to at most two of the boundaries, we have $2m \geq 4r$, i.e. $2r \leq m$. By Euler's Identity, we have $r=2+m-n$. Hence, $4+2m-2n \leq m$, i.e. $m \leq 2n-4$.
    \item For $K_{3,3}$, $n = 6$, $m = 9$, $m > 2n - 4$. Note that $K_{3,3}$ contains no triangle, so $K_{3,3}$ is nonplanar.
    \item This is true. First, $G$ contains no triangle because it is bipartite. Suppose that every vertex has degree 4 or more, then $2m \geq 4n$, i.e. $m \geq 2n$, which violates the inequality we proved in (a). Therefore, $G$ has a vertex of degree 3 or less.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \section{[GC] Problem 9.14}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Since the length of a smallest cycle in $G$ is 5, the boundary of every region has at least 5 edges. Because every edge belongs to at most two of the boundaries, we have $2m \geq 5r$. By Euler's Identity, we have $r=2+m-n$. Hence $2+m-n\leq\frac{2}{5}m$, i.e. $m \leq \frac{5}{3}(n-2)$.
    \item Petersen graph has 15 edges and 10 vertices, so $m > \frac{5}{3}(n-2)$. Since the length of a smallest cycle in Petersen graph is 5, it is nonplanar.
    \item Removing any vertex of the Petersen graph yields a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$, so the Peterson graph is nonplanar.

    \item Suppose, to the contrary that every vertex of $G$ has a degree of 3 or more, then $2m \geq 3n$. Therefore, $\frac{3}{2}n \leq m \leq \frac{5}{3}(n-2)$. After some algebra we get $n \geq 20$, which leads to contradiction.
